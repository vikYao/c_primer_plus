# c_primer_plus
This code repository is for the book **C Primer Plus - Sixth Edition**, and contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Project
The Project just records the learning progress of the C Primer Plus, and some personal thinking about the C language. It consists of three parts: 1) the program listing, 2) the programing exercises, and 3) some markdown files on thinking. The ultimate goal about the project is for those who are involved in this project to consolidate their knowledge of the C language, deepen influence and inspire them to think constantly, including myself.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, ch_02.

- computer environment: ubuntu 18.04

- gcc version 7.4.0

- vim configuration (.vimrc)

```shell
set cursorline
set hlsearch
set tabstop=4
set expandtab
set autoindent
```

## Compile and Run

Under the Unix-like operating system, The `gcc `and `cc` commands should work properly and compile our source code successfully. The compile command looks like this:

```shell
$> gcc [-o outfile] infile ...
$> gcc -lm [-o outfile] infile ...  # link math library
$> ./outfile                        # run
```
